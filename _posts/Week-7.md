# Weekly Blog Post: Project Progress and Key Discussions

This week, our team made great strides in shaping the user experience and design elements for our upcoming app, as well as progressing with backend tasks. Here’s a summary of what was discussed during our latest meeting:

## Wireframe and SOS Frame Design

Our wireframe, showcased by D3, has been a key focus. We’ve honed in on the **SOS frame design**, where the user can quickly share their location with an emergency contact. The SMS message that will be sent to the emergency contact was also finalized, ensuring clear communication in emergency situations.

## Map and Route Suggestions

A major feature in the works is the **map** that displays the user’s current location and suggests the most optimized route to safety. While we are still working on the **Safe Zone page**, which will notify users when they enter designated safe areas, these features are coming together nicely.

## Recording Surroundings and Sharing Location

Another important functionality involves the app’s ability to **record the user’s surroundings** and share their live location with a trusted contact. This adds an extra layer of security for users in uncertain situations.

## Style Guide and Logo

D3 also showcased the **Style Guide and Logo** this week. The design was inspired by the clear, intuitive route points seen in Google Maps, making navigation within the app seamless. To align our brand with the app’s feel, we agreed to **change the background color** to our brand colors, adding more cohesiveness to the design.

## UI Components and Research

On the **UI component** front, research into **UI Kitten** and the React Native documentation is ongoing to ensure we have all the necessary tools to create a responsive and visually appealing interface.

## Blog Update

A blog update is underway, with the **Check-in Notifications** section being refined to better highlight its core functionality. We're also integrating the **core values** established in Figma, adding image assets to support the narrative.

## Next Sprint

- **D3** will upload the finalized image assets to the shared Google Drive.
- **FSWD** will focus on setting up and connecting the database to ensure backend functionality is in place for future testing.

Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to move closer to our launch goals!
