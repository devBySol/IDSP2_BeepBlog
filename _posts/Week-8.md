# Weekly Blog Post: Project Progress and Key Discussions

This week, our team created the mvp of the application and worked on the

## Map Feature

The map functionality is live. You can now search for addresses using the search bar to access the fastest route and view the distance to their location. We also updated the map interface for improved user experience.

## New Landing Pages

Our new landing pages are implemented with an enhanced user interface, providing a more engaging and user-friendly introduction to the application.

## Alert Function with Haptic Feedback

Weâ€™ve introduced an SOS function on the emergency page. You can now activate the SOS feature by double-tapping the button, providing a quick and responsive emergency alert.

## Midterm Presentation Preparation

Our team is preparing for the upcoming midterm presentation at the BCIT Burnaby Campus. This presentation will showcase a live demo of the application along with an introduction to its main features.

## Next Sprint

- **D3**: Developing additional wireframes.
- **FSWD**: Continuing to implement new map features, database configurations, and emergency alert enhancements.

Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to move closer to our launch goals!
