Beep is a mobile app dedicated to enhancing safety for women, particularly when traveling alone at night. The app provides multiple key features to promote personal security:

### Real-time Location Sharing:

Users can share their live location with trusted contacts like family or friends. This feature ensures that someone always knows where the user is, offering peace of mind and swift help if needed.

### Emergency Alerts:

In situations of immediate danger, users can activate a loud alarm directly from the app to attract attention and deter potential threats. It also has a quick contact feature to notify emergency services or a designated contact.

### Crime Data Mapping:

The app integrates crime data to highlight potentially risky areas, providing users with safer route suggestions. By visualizing past crime reports, Beep helps individuals make informed decisions about their travel paths.

### Check-in Notifications:

The app allows scheduled check-ins. If a user doesnâ€™t check in at the expected time, it sends an automatic alert to their designated contacts.

These features make Beep an essential tool for anyone concerned about safety while traveling, offering a comprehensive solution to both prevent incidents and respond to emergencies.
