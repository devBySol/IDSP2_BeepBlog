_This week, our team made significant strides toward bringing the Beep app closer to launch._

## Onboarding & Registration

We completed the UI for the onboarding screens, including the full registration process, which now seamlessly stores user information to the database. This foundational work allows new users to easily sign up and get started on the app, setting the stage for a smooth first experience.

## GPS Tracking & Location Sharing

The map screen now supports live GPS tracking, allowing users to view their current location in real time. Additionally, we've successfully integrated the functionality to share location data with emergency contacts via SMS, ensuring users have a quick way to alert loved ones if they need assistance.

## SOS Button Enhancements

We've added a siren sound to the emergency SOS button, giving users an immediate audio alert option in critical situations. This is another step toward making the app’s emergency features more responsive and practical.

## Midterm Presentation & Demo

This week, we showcased Beep at the BCIT Burnaby campus during our midterm presentation. The live demo included an introduction to the app's core features, and we received valuable feedback from our audience, helping us refine our approach as we move forward.

## Safe Zone Data & Heat Map

We’re continuing to enhance our safety-focused features. Work is underway to pull data from the Google Maps API to display nearby safe businesses, public services, and open locations on the map. In parallel, we’re building out a crime heat map, importing local crime data to visually indicate areas of risk.

## D3 Team Progress

Our D3 team scouted filming locations around Vancouver for our app's ad reel and completed practice shots in preparation for the final cut. They’re also finalizing the high-fidelity screens for the SOS page, with all other main screens, including the map, safe zone, and profile, now complete.

_Stay tuned as we continue refining our app’s features and move closer to our vision of helping users feel safe and connected wherever they go!_
