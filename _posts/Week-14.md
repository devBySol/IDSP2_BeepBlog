## Showcase Preparation

This week, we focused on improving our presentation flow and refining our table flow to ensure a smooth and engaging experience for the showcase.

We held a mock presentation as a rehearsal and received valuable feedback from Henry, our project manager. His insights have helped us identify areas for improvement, and we are working on fine-tuning our delivery and organizing our flow more effectively.
