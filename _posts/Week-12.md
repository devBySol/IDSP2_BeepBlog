_This week, we focused on advancing Beep’s map features, safety tools, and UI optimizations, ensuring our app is both functional and intuitive._

## Refined SOS Functionality: Faster Activation and Improved Clarity

Following feedback from our last sprint testing, we made a small adjustment by reducing the countdown timer from 15 seconds to 10 seconds, making it more responsive in emergency situations. Additionally, the live location sharing feature is now activated through a web app link sent via SMS, which includes the user’s name for better clarity and identification. Assistance with styling this feature would be greatly appreciated to ensure it is both visually appealing and user-friendly.

## Crime Heat Map Enhancements with Data Integration

We have successfully integrated crime data updates sourced directly from Vancouver Police Department APIs. With red dot markers for specific incidents and cluster visualizations for zoomed-out views, users can easily interpret risk levels. This week, we also refined the heat map toggling system, making it more responsive and user-friendly.

## Comprehensive Crime Data Integration & Heat Map Visualization

We’ve integrated real-time crime data using Supabase, allowing users to view recent crime data with custom markers on the map. Additionally, we’ve created a merged view that combines the crime heat map with the standard map, giving users a comprehensive view of nearby safe zones and high-risk areas. This feature provides valuable insights to help users make informed decisions about their surroundings.

## Onboarding & Walkthrough Updates

To help users better understand Beep's features, we finalized high-fidelity screens for an interactive onboarding tutorial. First-time users will now be guided through the app's primary functionalities, such as the crime map, SafeZone, and SOS button, ensuring they feel confident navigating the app.

## High-Fidelity Light & Dark Mode Completion

Our design team completed the light mode layouts, ensuring that users can switch between light and dark themes. With consistent and accessible designs across both modes, Beep now accommodates diverse user preferences and lighting conditions, improving overall usability and comfort.

## Bug Fixing & UI Enhancements

This week, we tackled several challenges and made significant progress across key areas of development. We resolved issues with map place details. The current location and panning issue, which affected the display of crime data, was successfully fixed. We also integrated directional data from the API, including duration, destination, and detailed step-by-step instructions, while working on generating visuals for directions—though conflicts with multiple bottom sheets remain a focus. On the frontend, our developers made strides in creating static pages for the Profile and Settings sections, along with improvements to the map feature. These updates bring us closer to delivering a seamless user experience.

_This week’s progress is a testament to our team’s dedication to creating a reliable, user-centered safety app. Beep is evolving with every sprint, and we’re excited to bring these features closer to launch. Stay tuned for more updates next week!._
