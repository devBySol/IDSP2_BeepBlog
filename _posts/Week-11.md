_This week, we made significant strides in Beep’s design and functionality, focusing on adaptability and user-centered enhancements._

## High-Fidelity UI Completion & Light Mode Integration

The D3 team is finalizing high-fidelity screens, covering both dark and light modes to ensure a fully adaptive design. By the end of this week, 60-80% of the app’s interfaces will support light mode, giving users the choice between light and dark themes. This dual-mode design is integral to enhancing usability, as it caters to user preferences for different lighting conditions and visual comfort. Light mode integration also aligns with our commitment to accessibility, ensuring Beep is user-friendly in all environments.

## SOS Timer Enhancements & Emergency Sound Alert

Our SOS feature has been significantly refined with the addition of a countdown timer and loud alarm sound, ensuring an immediate, clear alert in emergencies. The button now requires a double-tap to activate, reducing accidental activations, and includes options to share live location data with emergency contacts via SMS. These updates make the SOS functionality more reliable and responsive for users facing urgent situations.

## Comprehensive Crime Data Integration & Heat Map Visualization

We’ve integrated real-time crime data using Supabase, allowing users to view recent crime data with custom markers on the map. Additionally, we’ve created a merged view that combines the crime heat map with the standard map, giving users a comprehensive view of nearby safe zones and high-risk areas. This feature provides valuable insights to help users make informed decisions about their surroundings.

## Interactive Onboarding & Tutorial Walkthrough

To streamline the onboarding experience, we completed high-fidelity frames for an interactive walkthrough. This tutorial introduces users to key features such as the crime map, SOS button, and SafeZone functionality. With a user-friendly walkthrough, first-time users can confidently navigate Beep’s essential safety tools.

## Optimized Map Interface & Dark Mode Enhancements

The D3 team also optimized the map interface with updated spacing and alignment for a cleaner, more user-friendly layout. Dark mode compatibility was further enhanced, providing a cohesive experience for users at night. The navigation icons now highlight in purple when selected, adding an interactive visual cue that aligns with Beep’s design language.

## Camera Access for Incident Documentation

In support of personal safety, we implemented a new camera access feature that allows users to capture photos during emergencies. Images are securely stored in Google Cloud, enabling users to document incidents if necessary. This feature is part of our broader commitment to ensuring Beep is a comprehensive safety tool for all users.

_Our team's dedication to high-fidelity design and robust safety features is bringing Beep closer to its goal of providing a reliable, adaptable, and user-centered safety app. Stay tuned as we finalize the design and continue refining Beep's features._
