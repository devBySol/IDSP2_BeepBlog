This week, we made significant progress with our app’s ideation and design, as well as advancing backend components. Here’s a summary of our latest updates:

## Ideation and User Research

We've further refined our app concept, aiming to provide women with **real-time safety information** while navigating urban environments. The app will analyze **local crime data**, **lighting conditions**, and **public transit availability** to suggest the safest routes.

Our team also reviewed insights from our **25-question user survey**, gathering valuable input from women aged 25-44 in Vancouver. The feedback emphasized the importance of features like **live location sharing**, **real-time updates**, and **emergency alerts**.

### Persona Development: Elara

This week, we fleshed out the persona of **Elara**, a 21-year-old Métis architecture student from Vancouver. Elara's primary concerns are **walking alone at night**, finding **safe shortcuts**, and keeping her family updated. Her needs shape our design, particularly around **live location sharing** and providing **safe route suggestions**.

## Key Safety Features

We’ve made significant progress on features such as:

- **Live location sharing** with emergency contacts
- **Preset distress messages** for emergency situations
- **Recording surroundings** for added security

These features are designed to minimize user interaction, allowing for seamless operation in high-stress scenarios.

## Map and UI Research

The **map** that displays users' current location and suggests safe routes is coming together. We’re also refining the **Safe Zone** functionality, notifying users when they enter safer, more populated areas.

In terms of **UI research**, we continued exploring **UI Kitten** and React Native documentation to build a user-friendly interface. Our goal is to make the app intuitive and responsive while keeping privacy and safety at the forefront.

## Next Sprint

- **Design Team** will finalize the **Safe Zone map** and continue working on the **SOS frame**.
- **Backend Team** will connect the app to the database to ensure functionality for **live updates** and **location tracking**.

Stay tuned for more updates as we continue working toward our app's launch!
