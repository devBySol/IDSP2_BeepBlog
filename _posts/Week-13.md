## Map AI Routing and Direction Navigation

This week, the FWSD team focused on enhancing map functionality, including AI-driven routing that prioritizes safety by avoiding areas with recent criminal activity. Additionally, progress was made on direct navigation, offering turn-by-turn guidance so users can follow the AI-recommended route and monitor their location in real time.

## Snapshot Features

We have completed the "Snapshot" feature, which allows users to capture and save images of their surroundings directly to the app's media history. This feature provides users with a way to document their environment as evidence, especially when they feel unsafe in unfamiliar areas. This feature also shows where users took the photo on a mini map in the app.

## Onboarding Screens

We have also developed onboarding screens to enhance the user experience. These screens provide a brief overview of the app, detailing each feature and explaining its purpose, ensuring new users quickly understand the app's functionality upon creating an account or loading it for the first time.

## Landing Page Built

The Beep landing page was successfully finalized this week: Beep Landing Page. This page serves as a comprehensive introduction to our app, offering detailed information about its features and functionality. It also highlights our core values and mission, showcasing the purpose behind our work. Additionally, the page includes a dedicated section introducing our team, giving visitors a glimpse of the people driving the project forward.

## Business Cards and Brochure:

The Brochure and business cards have been finalized and sent for print this week.
